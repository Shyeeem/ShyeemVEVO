- 👋 Hi, I’m Shyeem and I'm just making my way through the coding world
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, but they aren't coming to mind at the moment
- 🌱 I currently know Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL and a bit of Python 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, I made this github page to prove that I do work on *some* things (I'm still inconsistent)

<!---
